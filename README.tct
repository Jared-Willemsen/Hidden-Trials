To start the program run "hidden trails.py"
The JSON folder contains all the data for my program saved neatly in JSON files
Also if you choos load game at the start of the program you will be put at the end of the game with all the equipment so you don't have to play through the enire game to get to the boss,
but if you save the program at any point in the game you will lose the current save data.  

The rest you can probably figure out yourself ;)
